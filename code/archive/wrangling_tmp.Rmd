## Session Info
Session info for reproducibility
```{r session info}

# Download data
```{r download data}
# not included online, because the script contains a password
# source("code/wrangling/download_data.r")
```

```{r import data}
main_start <- read_csv("data/main_start.csv")

# for the purpose of getting excat participantt numbers per university,
# we used the raw data set
main_start <- read_csv("data/main_raw.csv")
```


# Wrangle Data
## Apply Exclusion Criteria
### Simple Criteria
Note that in main_start.r, we already excluded two participants whose current university was "Amsterdam", because according to our exclusion criteria we only aimed at students in the german-speakinig countries. This had to be done in main_start.r, because we removed some of the information for data protection reasons.
```{r exclusion_01}

```


### Surprising age
Some people are surprisingly young. Maybe typos in the age field? Otherwise, they seem to be normal students and have not left any comments. For us, it seems most likely that participants who indicate an age of 14 or 15 while studying e.g. in their 5th master's term either paid little attention or did not answer seriously. We therefore exclude participants who indicated an age of 14 or 15 (9 cases). The two 17-year-old participants in their first bachelor's term seem plausible however.
```{r}
main_step01 %>% pull(age) %>% table()

(surprising_age <- main_step01 %>% filter(age < 18))

surprising_age %>% 
  select(study_stage_mc, semester, age)

main_step01 <- main_step01 %>% 
  filter(age >16) # (up to here: 1467 observations)
```

### Illogical responses
This code chunk allows to check for illogical responses. An example of what we are looking for: A participant responds that she has never preregistered a study (coded `"6"`) , but also that she has preregistered her bachelor's thesis (coded `"3"`, full answer: `"6, 3"`). Such an answer was technically possible, but would be illogical and indicate problems with the answer. 
Thus, with the code below, we look for observations that contain a `"6"` but have more than one character, indicating that apart from `"6"`, another answer was given. If we find such observations, they are excluded from further analysis.
```{r exclusion_02}
# create marker variable 
# data frame is turned into long format in the process
main_illogical <- main_step01 %>% 
  gather(matches("qrp[0-9]"), matches("orp"), 
         key = "practice", value = "answer") %>% 
  mutate(illogical_answer = ifelse(answer %contains% "6" & nchar(answer) > 1, 
                                   TRUE, FALSE)) 

# look at how many problemativc observations there are
n_prob_items <- main_illogical %>% 
  select(illogical_answer) %>% 
  filter(illogical_answer == TRUE) %>% 
  nrow()

n_prob_items / (main_illogical %>% nrow())

# remove problematic observations
# data frame is turned back to wide format
# NAs are introduced in place of the problematic observations
main_step02 <- main_illogical %>% 
  filter(is.na(illogical_answer) | illogical_answer == FALSE) %>% 
  spread(key = "practice", value = "answer")
```

## Prepare date data
```{r date_data}
main_step03 <- main_step02 %>% 
  # prepare time data
  mutate(created = ymd_hms(created),  # transformation into ymd_hms format
         ended = ymd_hms(ended), # transformation into ymd_hms format
         length = dseconds(interval(created, ended))) %>%  # create duration vector
  identity()
```

## Prepare Factors


```{r factor_definition}
main_step05 <- main_step04 %>% 
  # mutate(uni_current = factor(uni_current)) %>% 
  mutate(study_stage_mc = factor(study_stage_mc, 
                                 labels = ),
         
         field_of_study_mc = factor(field_of_study_mc,
                                    labels = ),
         
         emp_experience = factor(emp_experience,
                                 labels = ),
         
         study_degree = factor(study_degree, levels = 1:5,
                               labels = ),
         
         study_degree_field = factor(study_degree_field, 
                                     labels = ),
         
         sex = factor(sex, 
                      labels = ),
         
         rc_teaching = factor(rc_teaching, 
                              labels = ),
         
         nosi = factor(nosi, labels = ),
         
         nosi_at_uni = ifelse(uni_current %in% nosi_unis, "Yes", "No"),
         
         nosi_events_mc = factor(nosi_events_mc, 
                                 labels = ))
```

  drop_na(qrp_id) %>% 
  transmute(qrp = dplyr::recode(qrp_id, 
                             "1" = "SR of Variables",

                             "10" = "None", 
                             "11" = "Not Sure")) %>%
