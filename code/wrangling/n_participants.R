# Purpose:        Extract total number of participants per university and number of 
#                 observations per university. Save those as .rds objects.
#                 Save a vector of universities with more than 30 observations.
# Output:         n_participants_raw.rds (total no. of participants)
#                 n_observations_uni.rds (no. of participants per university)
#                 unis_to_include.rds    (vector of universities with >30 obs.)

## Number of Participants per University

### Raw Number of Participants per University
# This number counts every participant once for their current/last university.

n_participants_raw <- main %>% 
  group_by(uni_current) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

### Adjusted Number of Participants per University
# This Number takes the fact into account that for one participant who did 
# their B.Sc. at university A and is currently enrollend in a M.Sc. programme at 
# university B, we actually have a participant for university A, *and* a 
# participant for university *B*, even though it's the same person.

# It's straightforward to count B.Sc. students.
n_subj_bsc <- main %>% filter(study_stage_mc == "Bachelor") %>% 
  group_by(uni_current) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  rename(uni = uni_current)

# Non-B.Sc. students who switched uni: 
# For these participants, we also count an observation for their bachelor university.
n_subj_bsc2 <- main %>% 
  filter(study_stage_mc != "Bachelor" & uni_current != uni_bachelor) %>% 
  group_by(uni_bachelor) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  rename(uni = uni_bachelor)

# total number of extra observations
n_subj_bsc2 %>% pull(n) %>% sum()

# Non-B.Sc. students are counted towards their current university 
# (university of last graduation for alumni),
n_subj_beyond.bsc <- main %>% filter(study_stage_mc != "Bachelor") %>% 
  group_by(uni_current) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  rename(uni = uni_current)

# aggregation
n_observations_uni <- bind_rows(n_subj_bsc, n_subj_bsc2, n_subj_beyond.bsc) %>% 
  group_by(uni) %>% summarise(n = sum(n))

# total number of university-level observations
n_observations_uni %>% pull(n) %>% sum()

### Take a look
n_observations_uni %>% arrange(n %>% desc()) %>% print(n = nrow(.))

### Subset of Universities to include in further analysis
unis_to_include <- n_observations_uni %>% filter(n >= 30)

# save data
write_csv(n_observations_uni, "data/n_observations_uni.csv")
write_csv(n_participants_raw, "data/n_participants_raw.csv")
